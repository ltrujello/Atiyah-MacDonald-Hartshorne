\begin{exercise}[Exercise 2.1]
    Prove the ``homogeneous Nullstellensatz,'' which says if $\fa
    \subseteq S$ is a homogeneous ideal, and if $f \in S$ is a homogeneous
    polynomial with $\deg f > 0$, such that $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in
    Z(\fa)$ in $\bbP^n$, then $f^q \in \fa$ for some $q >
    0$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    \luke{
        Let $\idl{a}$ be a homogeneous ideal of $k[x_0, \dots, x_n]$. 
    Then in $\bbP^n$, we have that  
    \[
        Z(\idl{a}) = \bigg\{ P \in \bbP^n \;\bigg|\; \text{For all } f \in \idl{a}, f(P) = 0  \bigg\}
    \]
    while in $\aa^{n+1}$, we have that 
    \[
        Z'(\idl{a}) = \bigg\{ Q \in \aa^{n+1} \;\bigg|\; \text{For all } f \in \idl{a}, f(Q) = 0  \bigg\}.
    \]
    We can write a surjective map $\pi: Z'(\idl{a}) \to Z(\idl{a})$ sending an affine point to its projective 
    equivalence class.
    In addition, for a projective point $P \in Z(\idl{a})$, we can observe that 
    $\pi^{-1}(P) \subset Z'(\idl{a})$ (the elements of $P$'s equivalence class). 
    
    Thus, if $f$ is homogeneous with a nonzero degree and $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Z(\idl{a})$, 
    then $f(Q) = 0$ for all $Q \in Z'(\idl{a})$. By the usual Nullstellensatz, 
    this implies that $f^q \in \idl{a}$ for some $q > 0$, which proves the result.

    For a homogeneous ideal $\fa \subseteq S$, show that the following
    conditions are equivalent:

        \item[(\emph{i}.)] $Z(\fa) = \emptyset$ (the empty set);
        \item[(\emph{ii}.)] $\sqrt{\fa} =$ either $S$ or the ideal $S_+ =
        \bigoplus_{d > 0}S_d$;
        \item[(\emph{iii}.)] $\fa \supseteq S_d$ for some $d > 0$.

            \item[$(i) \implies (ii)$] 
            Suppose $\idl{a}$ is a homogeneous ideal and $Z(\idl{a}) = \varnothing$. By the 
            homogeneous Nullstellensatz, it is vacuously true that for every 
            $f \in \oplus_{d > 0}S_d$, $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Z(\idl{a})$, and so 
            for every such $f$ there exists a $q > 0$ such that $f^q \in \idl{a}$. 
            Therefore, $\oplus_{d > 0}S_d \subseteq \sqrt{a}$. If $\idl{a}$ contains 
            a unit, then $\sqrt{\idl{a}} = S$. If $\idl{a}$ does not contain a unit, then 
            $\sqrt{\idl{a}} \subseteq \oplus_{d > 0}S_d \implies \oplus_{d > 0}S_d = \sqrt{\idl{a}}$.
    
            \item[$(ii) \implies (iii)$] 
            Suppose $\sqrt{a} = S$. Then this implies that $1 \in \idl{a} \implies \idl{a} = S$. Hence $S_d \subset \idl{a}$.
    
            Alternatively, subbPose $\sqrt{a} = \oplus_{d > 0}S_d$. Then for every $f \in \oplus_{d > 0}S_d$, 
            there exists a $q > 0$ such that $f^q \in \idl{a}$. In particular, there 
            exist $r_1, \dots, r_n$ such that 
            \[
                x_1^{r_1}, \dots, x_n^{r_n} \in \idl{a}.
            \]
            Take $d = r_1 + \cdots + r_n$. We claim that $S_d \subset \idl{a}$. 
            To see this, note that every degree-$d$ homogeneous polynomial is of the form 
            \[
                \sum_{k \ge 0}c_k x_1^{\alpha_1(k)} \cdots  x_n^{\alpha_n(k)}
            \]
            where only finitely many summands are nonzero and $\alpha_1(k) + \cdots + \alpha_n(k) = d$ is a sum 
            of nonnegative integers. Since 
            $d = r_1 + \cdots + r_n$, we know that for any summand $x_1^{\alpha_1(k)} \cdots  x_n^{\alpha_n(k)}$
            at least one $\alpha_i(k) \ge r_i$. Hence, the summand is in $\idl{a}$, and so the whole 
            sum is in $\idl{a}$. Therefore $S_d \subseteq \idl{a}$. 
    
            \item[$(iii) \implies (i)$] 
            Suppose $S_d \subseteq \idl{a}$ for $d > 0$. Then $Z(\idl{a})$ must 
            at least contain points $P$ such that $f(P) = 0$ for all $f \in S_d$.
            This includes the polynomials $x_1^d, \dots, x_n^d$. However, these $n$ polynomials 
            cannot all be simultaneously zero. Hence $Z(\idl{a}) = \varnothing$. 
        
        \end{description}
    }    
    \lfy{
    (i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii). Since $Z(\fa) = \emptyset$, the zero set of $\fa$ in affine space \luke{Did you mean projective space?} is either $\emptyset$ or $\{\mathbf{0}\}.$ In the first case, we certainly have $\sqrt{\fa} = S$. In the second case, we have $\sqrt{\fa} = \{p \in S: p(0) = 0\} = S_+$.

    (ii) $\Rightarrow$ (iii). It suffices to show that there exists $d$ such that all monomials of degree $d$ lies in $\fa$. Since $S_+ \subset \sqrt{\fa},$ for each $0 \leq i \leq n$, there exists $d_i$ such that $x_i^{d_i} \in \fa$. Let $d = n\sum_{i=0}^{n}d_i$. Then if a monomial has degree $d$, then there exists $i$ such that the exponent of $x_i$ in the monomial is at least $\sum_{i=0}^{n}d_i$, and therefore at least $d_i$, which implies that the monomial is in $\fa$.

    (iii) $\Rightarrow$ (i). If $S_d \subseteq \fa$ for some $d > 0$, then $x_i \in \sqrt{\fa}$ for every $0 \leq i \leq n$, which means that $Z(\fa) = Z(\sqrt{\fa}) = \emptyset$.

            \setcounter{enumi}{3}
            \item Suppose $f$ is homogeneous and $f \in I(Z(\idl{a}))$. Then 
            $f(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Z(\idl{a})$. By the homogeneous Nullstellensatz, 
            we see that $f \in \sqrt{\idl{a}}$.
            
            Suppose $f \in \idl{a}$. Then $f^q \in \idl{a}$ for some $q > 0$. 
            As $f^q(P) = 0$ for all $P \in Z(\idl{a})$, $f(P) = 0$ for all 
            $P \in Z(\idl{a})$ (as $k$ is an integral domain) and so it 
            follows that $f \in I(Z(\idl{a}))$.
            Our total work then shows that $I(Z(\idl{a})) = \sqrt{\idl{a}}$, as desired.
    
            \item
            We first know that $Y \subset Z(I(Y))$; we show that it is the smallest closed 
            set containing $Y$. Thus
            let $Z(J)$ be a closed set where $Y \subset Z(J) \subset I(Z(Y))$. 
            Then $I(Z(J)) \subset I(Y)$. Since $I(Z(J)) = \sqrt{J}$, we see that 
            $J \subset I(Y)$. Therefore, 
            $Z(I(Y)) \subset Z(J)$. Hence, $Z(I(Y)) = Z(J)$, and so $Z(I(Y)) = \overline{Y}$.

        We prove the harder direction that $Z(\fa) \subseteq \im(\rho_d).$ We may index the $N+1$ coordinates of a point in $\bbP^n$ by tuples of the form $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n)$ where $a_i \in \Z_{+}$ and the sum of all $a_i$'s is $d$. Given $\y \in Z(\fa)$, I claim that there exists $0 \leq i \leq n$ such that $y_{d\bbe_i} \neq 0$. Indeed, subbPose towards the contrary. Then since for any index $\bv = (a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n)$, $p(\y) = y_{\bv}^d - \prod_{i = 0}^{n}y_{d \bbe_i}^{a_i} \in \fa$, we have that $p(\y) = y_{\bv}^d = 0$, which implies that $y_{\bv} = 0$ for arbitrary $\bv$, which is absurd. 

        So fix some $i$ and some representative of $\y$ such that $y_{d\bbe_i} = 1$. Let $\xs \in \bbP^n$ be such that $x_i = y_{d\bbe_i} = 1$ and $x_j = y_{d\bbe_i - \bbe_i + \bbe_j}$. We claim that $\rho_d(\xs) = \y$. By construction, we already have that $x_i^{d-1}x_j = x_j = y_{d\bbe_i - \bbe_i + \bbe_j}$. It's straightforward to check that the polynomials in $\fa$ ensures that $y_{\bv} = M_{\bv}(\xs)$.

        To give an example to make this proof clearer, consider the example when $n = 1$ and $d = 3$. Then if $\y = (y_{30}, y_{21}, y_{12}, y_{03}) \in Z(\fa)$, subbPose WLOG that $y_{30} = 1$. Then $\y = \rho_d(1, y_{21})$. We check that since $y_{30}y_{12} - y_{21}^2 = 0$, indeed $y_{12} = y_{21}^2$. Similarly, since $y_{03}y_{30}^2 - y_{21}^3$, indeed $y_{03} = y_{21}^3$.

    \item Let $Y$ be a variety in $\bbP^n$, let $Y = Z(\mathfrak{a})$; and
    subbPose that $\mathfrak{a}$ can be generated by $q$ elements. Then show
    that $\Dim Y \ge n-q$. 
    \item Show that a strict complete intersection is a set-theoretic complete
    intersection.
    \item The converse of $(b)$ is false. For example let $Y$ be the twisted
    cubic curve in $\bbP^3$ {\emph{(Ex.\ 2.9)}}. Show that
    $I(Y)$ cannot be generated by two elements. On the other hand, find
    hypersurfaces $H_1,H_2$ of degrees $2,3$ respectively, such that
    $Y = H_1 \cap H_2$. 
    \item It is an unsolved problem whether every closed irreducible curve in
    $\bbP^3$ is a set-theoretic intersection of two surfaces.
